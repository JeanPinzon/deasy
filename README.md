# Deasy

Deasy is a simple CLI that helps developers to scaffold simple projects. We trust developers should use their time to solve complex problems, so our goal is do the simple job for them.

For a while, it just has the option to create a REST API based on [py-easy-rest](https://github.com/JeanPinzon/py-easy-rest) without cache and with a in memory repository. The template has the integration with Github Actions, Amazon EKS and docker hub.
